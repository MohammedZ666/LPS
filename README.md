# Local position system with ESPNow protocol
## Abstract ##
This paper briefly explains the methdologies of contructing a local postioning system with ESP32 chips using the ESPNow protocol. After completing readers will be able to -
* Get a brief overview of local position system
* Understand the specific methodology chosen for this local postitioning system 
* Learn about the basic capabilties of ESP32 chips
* Understand the implementation procedure of the methodology chosen
* Understand the code for Master and Slave ESP32 chips 
* Observe and analyze the efficiency, accuracy and, cost-effectiveness of such a system
* Compare it with modern local positioning systems
